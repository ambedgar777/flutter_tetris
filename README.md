<h1 style="font-size: 36px;">Tetris Game using Flutter and Dart</h1>

This repository contains a Tetris game built using Flutter and Dart. The game includes all the basic functionalities such as moving left, moving right, and rotation of the Tetriminos. When the game is over, a dialog is displayed showing the player's current score and a "Play Again" button.

<h1 style="font-size: 24px;">Gameplay</h1>
The objective of the game is to manipulate the falling Tetriminos to create horizontal lines without any gaps. When a complete line is formed, it disappears, and the player earns points. As the game progresses, the Tetriminos fall faster, making it more challenging.

<h1 style="font-size: 24px;">Controls</h1>
The game offers three buttons for controlling the Tetriminos:

Move Left: Tap this button to move the Tetrimino one step to the left.
Move Right: Tap this button to move the Tetrimino one step to the right.
Rotation: Tap this button to rotate the Tetrimino clockwise.
Game Over: When the game is over, a dialog will be displayed showing the player's current score. The player can then choose to play again by tapping the "Play Again" button.
